# Actually, Java is totally different from what I thought it would be ðŸ˜„  
### My First Java Program ðŸŽ‰

This is my first ever Java program â€” and it feels exciting to finally write something that runs!

I thought Java would be harder to get started with, but to my surprise, I actually found myself **struggling more with the mortgage payment formula** than the Java code itself ðŸ˜….

## ðŸ’¡ What the Program Does

- Calculates **monthly mortgage payments**
- Takes in:
  - Loan amount (principal)
  - Annual interest rate
  - Loan duration in years
- Uses the standard mortgage formula
- Displays the result in proper currency format
